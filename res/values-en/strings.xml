Unfortunately Androids widget API is not designed for frequent updates!
These can cause battery drainage and anything from lags till total
freezing of your launcher application. However Countdown Timer Widget is designed
to use as little battery as possible. When no timer is activated or the screen is turned
off Countdown Timer Widget will use no CPU and no battery. The alarms will be triggered anyway!
If you experience lags or find that your battery drainage has increased significantly using this widget
increase the refresh interval to an acceptable amount.
